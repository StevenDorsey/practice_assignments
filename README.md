## CPP_Assn1 Programming Assignment:
Problem:
Write a C++ program that will output information about you to the computer screen.
Make the computer format the output like this (with a blank line between each item):
> Name: <your_name>
>
> Major: <your major, spelled out, no acronyms>
>
>  Favorite Movie: <with title in double quotes, include the release year>


Replace the <…> with your own information. Here’s the output from my program:
> Name: Jill Seaman
>
> Major: Computer Science
> 
> Favorite Movie: “The Princess Bride” 1987
Note: It's ok if the last line is long and wraps onto the next line in your output.
